The files inside the 'data' folder are the raw data, some of which have been preprocessed using Microsoft Excel.
Specifically for location & smoking data, after using Microsoft Excel, I used Python for further data preprocessing: merging existing data & creating more variables.

After, I merged all of the data in 'merge_all.ipynb' as the final data preprocessing step, and exported it as 'all_merged.csv'.
